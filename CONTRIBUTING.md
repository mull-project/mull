# How to contribute

There are several ways you can help the project.

### Spread the word

We have found that not many people are aware of Mutation Testing. You can help 
by simply asking your colleagues or friends about their opinion on mutation testing.

### Give it a try

Try using Mull on one of your projects, or on one of the many open source
projects. Mull uses JIT for performance and flexibility, which is inherently
complex and easy to get wrong. We covered some cases, but certainly not all of
them. The project would benefit from more samples.

### Ask questions

You might get confused by the documentation, or by our design decisions. Some of
the decisions are done on purpose, some of them are accidental. If something is
not clear, confusing, or can be improved - please open an issue and raise your
concern.

### File a bug report

If you gave it a try, then you probably hit some bug or crash. Please, file
a report, we will take care of it eventually.

### Implement new features

There is a non-exhaustive [list](https://github.com/mull-project/mull/issues)
of planned features. Feel free to implement any of them, or come up with some
features you think would be beneficial for the project.

Here is the starting point: [Hacking on Mull](https://mull.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HackingOnMull.html).
