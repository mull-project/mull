Hacking On Mull
===============

Internals
*********

Before you start hacking it may be helpful to get through the second and third sections of this paper:
`Mull it over: mutation testing based on LLVM <https://lowlevelbits.org/pdfs/Mull_Mutation_2018.pdf>`_
from `ICST 2018 <https://www.es.mdh.se/icst2018/>`_.

Development Setup using Vagrant
*******************************

Mull supplies a number of ready to use virtual machines based on `VirtualBox <http://virtualbox.org>`_.

The machines are managed using `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com>`_ and `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com>`_.

Do the following steps to setup a virtual machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd infrastructure
    vagrant up debian

This command will:

- setup a virtual machine
- install required packages (cmake, sqlite3, pkg-config, ...)
- download precompiled version of LLVM
- build Mull against the LLVM
- run Mull's test suite
- run Mull against OpenSSL and fmtlib as an integration test

Once the machine is up and running you can start hacking over SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant ssh debian

Within the virtual machine Mull's sources located under ``/opt/mull``.

Alternatively, you can setup a remote toolchain within your IDE, if it supports
it.

When you are done feel free to drop the virtual machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant destroy debian

You can see the full list of supplied VMs by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant status

Local Development Setup
***********************

You can replicate all the steps managed by Vagrant/Ansible manually.

Required packages
-----------------

Please, look at the corresponding Ansible playbook (``debian-playbook.yaml``,
``macos-playbook.yaml``, etc.) for the list of packages required on your OS.

LLVM
----

You need LLVM to build and debug Mull.
You can use any LLVM version between 7.0 and 13.0.

There are several options:

1. Download precompiled version of LLVM from the official website: http://releases.llvm.org/
   This is a recommended option. Use it whenever possible. Simply download the
   tarball and unpack it somewhere.

2. Build LLVM from scratch on your own
   This option also works. Use it whenever you cannot or do not want to use precompiled version.

3. Ask Mull to build LLVM for you
   This is recommended only if you need to debug some issue in Mull that
   requires deep dive into the LLVM itself.

**If you are going for an option 2 or 3 - make sure you also include Clang.**

Build Mull
----------

Create a build folder and initialize build system:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mull-project/mull.git --recursive
    cd mull
    mkdir build.dir
    cd build.dir
    cmake -DPATH_TO_LLVM=path/to/llvm ..
    make mull-cxx
    make mull-tests

The ``PATH_TO_LLVM`` depends on which option you picked in previous section:

1. Path to extracted tarball.
2. Path to a build directory.
3. Path to a source directory.

If you are getting linker errors, then it is very likely related to the C++
ABI. Depending on your OS/setup you may need to tweak the ``_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`` (0 or 1):

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DPATH_TO_LLVM=some-path -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 ..

If the linker error you get is something like ``undefined reference to `typeinfo for irm::CmpInstPredicateReplacement'``,
try to pass the ``-fno-rtti`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DPATH_TO_LLVM=some-path -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fno-rtti ..
