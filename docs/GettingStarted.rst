Getting Started
===============

Hello there, we are glad to have you here!

If you are new to the subject, then we recommend you start with the little `Introduction into Mutation Testing <MutationTestingIntro.html>`_.
Then, `install Mull <Installation.html>`_ and go through the `tutorials <Tutorials.html>`_.

As soon as you are comfortable with the basics you may want to learn about various `options and settings <CommandLineReference.html>`_ Mull has,
as well as pick the right set of available `mutation operators <SupportedMutations.html>`_.

If you are curious about how Mull works under the hood: `How Mull works <HowMullWorks.html>`_.

If you want to dive deeper and look behind the curtains, then we encourage you to `hack on Mull <HackingOnMull.html>`_.

If you have any questions feel free to `open an issue <https://github.com/mull-project/mull/issues/new>`_ or join the great community of researchers and practitioners on `Discord <https://discord.gg/Hphp7dW>`_.
