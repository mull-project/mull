=======

There are several ways to get help with Mull:

- `Open an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/mull-project/mull/issues/new>`_ describing your problem.

- `Come over to the Discord server <https://discord.gg/Hphp7dW>`_ and ask your questions directly (do not hesitate to tag ``@AlexDenisov`` there).

We are also happy to accommodate **commercial** or **academia users** - `reach out to the authors <mailto:alex@lowlevelbits.org>`_ directly and we will set you up.
